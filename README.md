# data-mining-project
The project has the following files
1. elbow.py : determines the optimal number of clusters
2. k_means.py : clusters the accidents into k clustes using k-means clustering
3. chi_sqr.py : reveals the impact of various features on severity of accident
4. id3.py : builds a decision tree for each cluster to predict severity of accidents
5. apriori.py : derives association rules to reveal relations between different factors
6. arima.py : forecasts te number of accidents in the furure
7. requirements.txt : lists the python packages used in the project

## Implementation
1. Create a virtual python environment using python -m venv env
2. Install all required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run elbow method to determine the number of clusters
4. Run k-means clustering to cluster the accidents
5. Run the other data mining algorithms
